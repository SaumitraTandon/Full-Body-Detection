# Full Body Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that uses the OpenCV library to detect full human bodies in an image using a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:
## Usage

1. Open the `Full Body Detection.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

2. Make sure that the file paths in the notebook point to the correct locations for the `fullbody.xml` cascade classifier and the input image.

3. Run the cells in the notebook.

The notebook will process the specified image and display the result with detected full human bodies highlighted by green rectangles.
